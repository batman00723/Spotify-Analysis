    "Analysing key distributions over 4 decades spotify can inform it's curation, recomendation algo and team.\n",
    "Also over decades energy ,danceability and loudness has also increased means spotify can curate playlists for modern listeners and for millenials who like older songs spotify can recomend them songs like those of older trends we have seen.\n",
    "Also duration trend also shows that shortening the attenttion spans over decades and in modern times listeners want more loud, dancable, and energetic songs, listeners want to enjoy song in shorter time and move on to next songs, this shortening of songs is also due to introducction of short form content applications like tik-tok. In tik-tok there is arrangement of dance to songs so to hook consumer they need to make watcher hooked into their 30 sec content, so they use catchy hook of songs, more loud, energetic, and more dancable songs as they tend to grab attention quickly.\n",
    "Importantly, key analysis shows in modern times coexistence of electronic friendly and guitar friendly keys. This indicates that modern tracks are electronically produced and also for band driven acoustic arrangements.\n",
    "Because in modern times users atttention span has shortened so artists need to make songs that are cachy from 1st second. So spotify needs to recomend those those songs to gen-z listeners, also listeners who prefer older songs soptify can make its recomandation system better to make users to use spotify more and more.\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Song duration: \n",
    "Since the 1980s, average track duration dropped from about 4.3 minutes to just over 3 minutes today, reflecting shorter attention spans and the rise of streaming and short-form content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Energy and loudness:\n",
    "They peaked around 2010, while danceability has gradually increased, showing that modern music favors more engaging, rhythm-driven tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Electronic production domination: \n",
    "Acousticness has declined over the decades, highlighting the shift from organic, instrument-driven songs to digitally produced sounds in contemporary music.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explicit content is also a major factor in hits: \n",
    "While only ~15% of all songs are explicit, nearly 37% of popular tracks contain explicit lyrics, reflecting the influence of hip-hop, trap, and streaming-era listening trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keys reveal compositional trends: \n",
    "Earlier decades favored keys like C, G, and A, whereas C# and other electronic-friendly tones have gained prominence post-2010, signaling changing musical tastes and production styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popularity is multi-dimensional: \n",
    "High energy, loudness, and danceability helps, but hits mostly depends upon catchy hooks, explicit content, marketing, artist's popularity and evolving genre trends ‚Äî showing that musical success isn‚Äôt determined by audio features alone."
